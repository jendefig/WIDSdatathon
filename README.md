# WIDSdatathon

This is a project in association with the Global Women in Data Science Conference (March 2, 2020). WIDS is hosting this datathon challenge in which we will use patient health data provided by MIT GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) Initiative to predict patient survival.
